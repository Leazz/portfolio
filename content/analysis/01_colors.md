Color analysis
=======================

Analysis of three websites and a short report on color analysis.

Selection
-----------------------
I have selected three different sites to analyze wich are:
1. https://www.willys.se/ >> Supermarket.
2. https://glitter.se/ >> Accessorise store.
3. https://www.lindex.com/se >> Clothing store.

* I chose three popular sites for people who are interested in shopping and buying online.

Method
-----------------------

* I have used >> https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel << to find out the color palette and color scheme.
* In addition, I used the inspection tab to find out the type of font on each page.

Results
-----------------------
As mentioned in color section in the guide that there are many different types of color schemes and these are some of them:
* Monochromatic color scheme.
* Complement color scheme.
* Analogue color scheme.
* Triadic color scheme.

Analysis
-----------------------

Regarding the results I got, I noticed that the web developers quote the colors of the website pages from the company's logo, in addition to adding other colors so they are consistent and comfortable for the eye (visual balance) to maintain readability.
Colors affect the psyche and emotions of people, For this, the colors of websites must be chosen carfully so as not to alienate the visitor.
i also noticed that the sans-serif font type is the most used by the websites.
To avoid contrast issues, black an white make a good pairing and red is useful also.
There are colors that encourage a person to click on it, such as blue color, and other colors that do not stop the person such as a purple, I agree with this point, because I notice  this on myseld whan I shop online, and if this talk indicates somthing, it indicate this importance of chosing colors and attracting the visitor to the page.
