design princip
=======================

I will evaluate and analyze the designs of three prsonal websites, I will do this by expressing my opinion according to my own taste and on the basis of established principles of what distinguishes design.

Selection
-----------------------

I searched for personal web pages and chose three websites. I chose based on my admiration for the design of these pages and the beautiful creativity found in them and the feeling.
pages that i chose are:
1. https://www.colin-moy.com/ >>  graphic design for publicity and marketing.
2. https://www.ojieame.design/ >>  product designer.
3. https://kylecraven.design/ >>  digital designer and creative Webflow developer

Method
-----------------------

I will analyze the selected pages above by using https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/
which contains a lot of information regarding displaying different design principles.

Results
-----------------------
## Colin Moy website.
![Colin moy](%assets_url%/img/colin.jpg)

At the top of the page we see the name of the designer and between the first and the lase neme we see a moving bar containing the skills (GRAPHIC Design • Creative Problem Solver • ARt DIRECTION • Organiser of Information • Creative Direction Strategic thinker ) that the designer has, and we notice after the last name there is an arrow that when clicked takes us to the bottom of the pages where there are three options which are:
* about
* portfolio
* conact

At the end of the page there is an instagram icon.
When clickin on about option, we see a definition of the designer and information about her ( graphic design for publicity and marketing ), and when clicking on portfolio , it shows us many projects that she has worked on by displaying them in the form of pictures. When we take the cursor to the left, it takes us to the left of the page, and when we take the cursor to the right, it takes us to the right of the page. when we click on contact, three boxes appear in which the visitor's information can be filled in, so that he can communicate with the designer.
Colen Moy created a simple, livly, and consistent design by relying most on choosing a unified color for the page, which is yellow, which gives a sense of enthusiasism and vitality, and the color was the most important to highlight the design of her page.
As she used the grid principle in her page design, as it found in her design severel rows indicating that, as by using this principle she kept the content tidy and gave it a good appearance.
Movment was used for several elements, so when moving the cursor on the letter O in her first and last name, a movment apears, and so on When we take the cursor to the left, it takes us to the left of the page, and when we take the cursor to the right, it takes us to the right of the page.
Where she used the principle of typography, where the designer used it to highlight herself and her skills at the beginning of the page, and it was like the title, but in the name of the designer in a large, bold and distinctive font.
In addition, the designer used the principle of balance, we can see the balance by displaying the sizes of the images placed inside the portfolio option to highlight her projects. They were placed in similar sizes, which gave a sense of consistency.

## Ojieame website.
![Ojieame](%assets_url%/img/ojieame.jpg)

We see that the designer started at the beginning of the page by placing a picture of himself and a written text by which he introduces himself, he is an enthusiastic product designer currently shaping the future of software development by designing smooth user-interfaces that promote user interaction with information and data. While traveling around the world. When we go down a little bit, we see that he has expressed his skills (Graphic Design, Interface Design &
User Experience), and after that we can see that he wrote the process and attached an image to the right of the page that can express  Something he wrote and explained. After that, he attached pictures of the current projects, where on the right of the page there is an arrow that we can click on to move between the attached projects.  Including a description of the professional biography with the attachment of the resume to the right of the page within a field that we can click on.  In addition, he wrote about himself and chose an animated background for the part he spoke about himself.  At the end of the page, he attached a picture on the left that also expresses the text of the writing he attached, which is how to communicate with him for those interested.  We can notice that there is a logo at the top of the page on the left that moves with us wherever we are, whether at the bottom or at the top of the page.

The designer created a creative and enthusiastic design by choosing the black color in a distinctive way, which gave a sense of seriousness and accuracy in the work.
The designer used more than one principle in designing the page, and this means that he used the principle of Composition.
Where he used the principle of transparency which is a great technique for generating a sense of movement in static images. In addition, he used the principle of balance, and we can see this by attaching pictures in a beautiful and tidy way.
I also saw some beautiful randomness in his design.
The designer also used the principle of scale. We can notice this by attaching side images that help the viewer to understand the meaning immediately.
For this reason I analyzed the design of the designer he chose the principle of expression in the design of his page. it’s actually one of the more fun elements of design. This is where you can play, experiment and make a good design look great.

## Kyle Craven website.

The designer started by attaching the communication field at the top right of the page (Conact), and then he settled for writing his profession as a digital designer and webflow developer at the beginning of the page as an introduction or title, and after that he wrote about himself that he work with brands globally to create purpose driven websites that leave a lasting impression. when we go down a little we see that he showed pictures of the selected projects, and at the bottom The page includes three Instagram, Twitter and Webflow icons, with another box similar to the box on the top right of the page, but with different writing. (Get in touch).

The designer followed a simple, elegant, and calm style in designing the page, as he chose a light color of white derivatives, a color that is pleasing to the eye and gives a feeling of comfort.

The designer used the principle of grid system to which each element has been aligned, making for a striking, neat and attractive design.
In addition, he used theprinciple of balance, and we can see this throgh the consistency between the images and their size.
He also use the principle of Typography which is arguably one of the biggest foundations of design, We notice this by starting the designer with a summary of what he can do (digital designer and webflow developer) in a big and bold font.

## My website
![Lea Alfawaz](%assets_url%/img/lea.jpg)

The goal of creating my site is that it is a basic requirement in the training course that students must do, as it is a place to collect all the tasks required to be performed during the course, and this constitutes a difference between my site and the sites that were mentioned above.

At the top of the page, there is a side image on the left that indicates what I do, which is programming, and next to it is my name, and after that there is a bar that contains options that can be navigated through, and after that there is a text introducing myself, and at the bottom of the page there are four icons  GitHub and DebbieWeb are two fields through which we can change the color of the page from light to dark and vice versa.

I created a simple site according to my design experience, especially since I am considered a beginner, but I consider that I have done a good job since I am still a beginner. I used grids principle on my site, which gave a consistent and tidy look.
I used also balance principle.
I see that I am at the beginning of the road in design and that I have a lot in front of me to learn so that I can develop myself more.  But in principle, I am satisfied with what I have done.

Analysis
-----------------------
In general, the three selected pages were elegant and symmetrical, and they maintained the uniformity and elegance of the page, which attracts the attention of users.
And I also noticed that it united many animated elements that also give attention.

As for Colin's website, it was distinguished by its unified, vibrant yellow color that gave a feeling of enthusiasm, which is a unique thing for users and visitors when they visit the site. It is important for them to feel comfortable when dealing with the site.

And when we talk about Ojieame, he showed his creativity in designing his website in a professional and creative way, as we can see that he initially described himself as enthusiastic, and he proved this through the sense of enthusiasm that his design of the site gave to the visitor.

And when we talk about Kyle, he chose a creative, simple and smooth design, and this is a good thing for users, as they can easily understand everything in a flexible way.

I think I will make some updates on my site in terms of highlighting a better introduction to the page.
In my own opinion, my page is not excellent, but it is not bad either. With regard to my experience in design and the short time that I designed this page, it was a good thing. I think that I need to develop my site after I saw the beautiful things that a designer can do. I will  Focus on your thinking and develop page title consistency.
