One of the good ways to reduce the loading time of the page, which also helps to improve it:
* Enable compression to reduce the size of CSS;HTML and javascript files that are larger that 150 bytes.
* Page speed can be greatly increased when you optimize your code.
* Reduce rediects.
* Remove render- blocking Javascript leverage browser caching.
* Improve server response time.
* Use a content distribution network.
* Optimize image.

The least performing site among the aforementioned sites is http://comviq.se, with a performance rate of 22.6 % on mobile devices and 72 % on desktop. While best performing among the sites mentioned was http://studera.nu where the percentage of performance on mobile devices reached 58% and on desktop 94%, and this is considered excellent.
As for http://zalando.se, the performance rate on mobile devices reached 33 %, and 76% on desktop.
As for blocking time, there were 2.1533 ms at Zalando site, 4.02 ms at Comviq and 90 ms at studera nu. The shorter the blocking time, the better the site performance. The page load in Zalando was 2.4 and Comviq 2.9 s, while in Studera nu was 3.0 s on mobile devices, and on desktop for all sites, the loading time was less than a secon, and this is a good things.
I also noticed that the page load time ranged between 0 and 3 seconds.
http://studera.nu site was considered the winner among the siteI mentiond above, and this is due to the good performance which is 94 %.
