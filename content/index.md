welcome to my page

==========================

The source for this page is in `content/index.md`.

Hello,

My name is Lea Alfawaz.

Born in Syria and raised in Kuwait.

I have worked as a social worker in an English school and that was my first job.
I have worked and studied English literature at the same time.

In 2015 I came to Sweden, I have started studying the Swedish language to be able to integrate into society. I did the same thing as I did before, I studied and worked at the same time.

I worked as a student assistant, teacher at SFI. And now I study web programming at BTH.
